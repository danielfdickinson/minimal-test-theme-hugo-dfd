This theme is mostly not intended to be used as a normal theme. It is intended as a framework for creating minimal reproducible test cases. As such, one does not simply drop it in a site, but rather creates a repository specifically designed to isolate and demonstrate the issue one is facing.

The goal is to minimize the amount of 'layout grunt work' one has to do to create the test case.

[Daniel F. Dickinson](https://github.com/danielfdickinson), however does use this for demo sites for the modules on which he works.

See [License](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/minimal-test-theme-hugo-dfd/blob/master/LICENSE) for permissions on use.
